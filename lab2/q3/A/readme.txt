You just have to fill in A.py and grad_descent.py in algos folder. 
Fill only in the TODO markers.

For the A.py file, you can change code after 
"if __name__ == '__main__': 
    import argparse
    ...
"
You can run A.py as
python A.py --data_folder ../data/datasets/D/ --tolerance 1e-2 --max_epochs 10000 

You can change the default values of data_folder, tolerance and max_epochs as you like.
for example you can choose any one of folders A, D in ../data/datasets/

But mainly dataset D is gradient descent friendly.
